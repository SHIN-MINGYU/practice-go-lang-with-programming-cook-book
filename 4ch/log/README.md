# Logging

- logging is nomally used when the error is final result
- if not, log is recorded so many times

- also, if there are so many logs, it is difficult to search useful information
- but if there are so little logs, it is difficult to understand what happened in code

- But this Approach have some problems
- first, the case of using middle-level function used context
- second, if various variables are recorded in logs, so it will be complicated that we write code
